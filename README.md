## Project Overview ðŸŽ‰

"Recipe Shopping App" is a responsive web application built with React and TypeScript that allows users to browse culinary recipes fetched from the Tasty API. Once logged in, users can add their own recipes or create shopping lists based on recipe ingredients. Both user recipes and shopping lists are stored in Firebase.

#### Browsing Recipes

Upon accessing the main page, users are presented with recipes fetched from the Tasty API. Each recipe includes a name, description, and image. Users can scroll through the list of recipes and click on a recipe to view its full description and list of ingredients.

#### Login and Registration

The application allows users to log in or register using their email and password.

#### Adding Recipes

Once logged in, users can add their own recipes.
To add a recipe, users need to provide its name, description, ingredients, and an image.
After adding a recipe, it will be available in the list of recipes for that user.

#### Creating Shopping Lists

Once logged in, users can create shopping lists based on recipe ingredients.
Users can select a recipe from the available list, and the app will automatically generate a shopping list containing the required ingredients.
Users can add and remove items from the shopping list.
The shopping list is saved and available upon re-logging.

### React 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
